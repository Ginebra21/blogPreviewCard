- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge was the  very first attempt I've done totally on my own using HTML5 and CSS, so I was pretty nervous about it. Took me about a week to complete it, considering work, studies and not being at my house for 3 days and a half. I was able to learn better about the marging and padding ways to be added in the different parts of the code. I was able to happily implement the change of color for hover from a previous activity I had for my programming classes at college.

### Continued development

I'm eager to start adding JavaScript to my projects, getting better in CSS as I already feel very comfortable in HTML5. I'm sure that I'm still missing a lot of syntaxis for both of them, however, I'm sure that it will be information that will come up easier and easier with the time.
